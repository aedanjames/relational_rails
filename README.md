## Overview
[Relational Rails](https://github.com/aedanjames/relational_rails) is the first week-long paired project of Module 2 at Turing School Of Software and Engineering back-end engineering program.    

The application allows users to navigate a website, utilizing CRUD functionality to Create, Read, Update and Delete data entries. The user can visualize the changes they make.     

## Goals Achieved
- Design a one-to-many relationship utilizing a schema designer.
- Write migrations to create tables with columns of varying data types and foreign keys. 
- Use Rails to create web pages that allow users to CRUD resources.
- Create instance and class methods on a Rails model that use ActiveRecord methods and helpers.
- Write model and feature tests that fully cover data logic and user behavior.
